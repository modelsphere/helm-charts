{{/*
  The pod spec every SGLang pod in this chart shares.

  There are three of them and they differ far less than they look:

    single   the Deployment's pod -- one node, serves traffic.
    leader   rank 0 of a LeaderWorkerSet group -- serves traffic AND drives the
             cross-node NCCL group.
    worker   rank 1..n-1 of that group -- never serves traffic; SGLang only
             starts the HTTP server on rank 0.

  Everything that is genuinely the same (the model volume, the model-check init
  container, the engine image, env, resources, scheduling) is written once here,
  so leader and worker cannot drift apart -- a mismatched --tp or a model volume
  present on one side only does not fail at render time, it fails minutes later
  as a NCCL timeout that reads like a network fault.

  What the role actually decides:

    - the engine command form. `single` keeps the exec form
      (sglang serve, no shell). Multi-node pods need a shell,
      for two reasons that both matter: --node-rank has to come from
      ${LWS_WORKER_INDEX} at runtime, and the rdma-injector webhook only prepends
      its `source /etc/gpu-node/nccl-ib.env` (the per-node NCCL_IB_HCA pipeline)
      to containers started as bash/sh -c. An exec-form container gets the
      hostPath mount and nothing else -- RDMA then silently falls back to the
      wrong HCA rather than failing.
      Neither form is built under commandOverride, which also frees
      model.localPath and model.gpus to be empty (see values.yaml).
    - --nnodes / --node-rank / --dist-init-addr, added only for lws roles.
    - probes, the hang-watcher sidecar and the container port: `serves` roles
      only. There is nothing listening on a worker to probe.
    - preStop: see sglang.preStopScript.

  Call it as:  include "sglang.podSpec" (dict "root" $ "role" "leader")

  The work is split into three defines so the pd colocate shape can put TWO
  engines (and two hang-watchers) into ONE pod without copying the engine
  container:

    sglang.engineIdentity   turns a role into everything the engine command and
                            its probes/preStop need -- the flags, the pd trio,
                            the colocate port-name offset -- as a YAML dict, so
                            a caller two hundred lines away reads ONE source of
                            truth instead of re-deriving it. Renders nothing on
                            its own; the dict is the whole output.
    sglang.engineContainers the engine's container list item, plus the
                            hang-watcher sidecar that watches it. Consumes the
                            identity dict. Emits list items only (no
                            `containers:` key) so colocate can interleave its
                            router container.
    sglang.podSpec          the whole one-engine pod: prologue, the identity,
                            initContainers, `containers:` + engineContainers,
                            then the volumes/scheduling scaffold.

{{/*
  The preStop hook's drain script, shared by the Deployment pod and the LWS
  leader. `kill` adds the LWS-only tail.

  Stage 1a (endpointSyncSeconds) always waits: Kubernetes removes the pod from
  the EndpointSlice and runs this hook at the SAME time, and the pod has no way
  to observe that removal. Stage 1b then watches SGLang's own metrics and returns
  as soon as the server goes idle, so a quiet pod shuts down in about
  endpointSyncSeconds rather than always burning drainSeconds.

  The tail (`kill`) exists because of how LWS tears a group down. It deletes the
  leader FIRST, so the leader takes SIGTERM while its workers are still running
  and still expecting it in the next collective. SGLang's own SIGTERM drain then
  blocks inside cross-node NCCL, PID 1 sits in do_wait, and the pod burns the
  entire terminationGracePeriodSeconds before the kubelet SIGKILLs it -- holding
  its GPUs the whole time, which on a full cluster is exactly what the
  replacement group is waiting for.

  What the tail may NOT do is SIGKILL PID 1. A process inside a PID namespace
  cannot kill that namespace's init: the kernel drops signals the init has no
  handler for, and SIGKILL can never have one (man 7 pid_namespaces). kill(2)
  still returns 0, so it reads as success while doing nothing.

  What works is the pair below. SIGTERM to PID 1 IS delivered, because SGLang
  installs a handler for it -- so the hook starts the real shutdown itself,
  inside the grace period. Then it waits shutdownReserveSeconds: if PID 1 exits,
  the kernel tears the PID namespace down and takes this hook with it, so simply
  surviving that sleep means SGLang is wedged. At that point its CHILDREN get
  SIGKILLed -- they carry no such protection -- and their death releases the
  do_wait PID 1 is parked in, so it exits on its own.

  Why the kill half exists at all: SGLang deleted mid-load misses SIGTERM (uvicorn has
  not installed its handler yet), finishes booting, and then holds its GPUs until the
  kubelet SIGKILLs it at terminationGracePeriodSeconds -- an hour, for these values.
  Both roles hit that, which is why `kill` is not lws-only; the caller decides.

  Call it as: include "sglang.preStopScript" (dict "root" $ "kill" true)
