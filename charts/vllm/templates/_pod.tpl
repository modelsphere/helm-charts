{{/*
  The pod spec every vLLM pod in this chart shares.

  There are three of them and they differ far less than they look:

    single   the Deployment's pod -- one node, serves traffic.
    leader   rank 0 of a LeaderWorkerSet group -- serves traffic AND hosts the
             group's rendezvous (torch TCPStore on lws.distPort).
    worker   rank 1..n-1 of that group -- runs vLLM --headless: GPU workers
             only, no API server, never serves traffic.

  Everything that is genuinely the same (the model volume, the model-check init
  container, the engine image, env, resources, scheduling) is written once here,
  so leader and worker cannot drift apart -- a mismatched
  --tensor-parallel-size or a model volume present on one side only does not
  fail at render time, it fails minutes later as a NCCL timeout that reads like
  a network fault.

  What the role actually decides:

    - the engine command form. Every role runs `vllm serve` (the image's own
      entrypoint, and the only CLI that handles --headless). `single` keeps the
      exec form (no shell). Multi-node pods need a shell, for two reasons that
      both matter:
        * --node-rank has to come from ${LWS_WORKER_INDEX} at runtime.
        * the rdma-injector webhook only prepends its
          `source /etc/gpu-node/nccl-ib.env` (the per-node NCCL_IB_HCA pipeline)
          to containers started as bash/sh -c. An exec-form container gets the
          hostPath mount and nothing else -- RDMA then silently falls back to
          the wrong HCA rather than failing.
      Neither form is built under commandOverride, which also frees
      model.localPath and model.gpus to be empty (see values.yaml).
    - --nnodes / --node-rank / --master-addr / --master-port /
      --distributed-executor-backend, added only for lws roles, plus
      --headless on workers.
    - probes, the hang-watcher sidecar and the container port: `serves` roles
      only. There is nothing listening on a worker to probe.
    - preStop: see vllm.preStopScript.
