{{/*
  The pod spec every vLLM pod in this chart shares.

  There are three of them and they differ far less than they look:

    single   the Deployment's pod -- one node, serves traffic.
    leader   rank 0 of a LeaderWorkerSet group -- serves traffic AND drives the
             cross-node NCCL group.
    worker   rank 1..n-1 of that group -- runs vLLM --headless: GPU workers
             only, no API server, never serves traffic.

  Everything that is genuinely the same (the model volume, the model-check init
  container, the engine image, env, resources, scheduling) is written once here,
  so leader and worker cannot drift apart -- a mismatched
  --tensor-parallel-size or a model volume present on one side only does not
  fail at render time, it fails minutes later as a NCCL timeout that reads like
  a network fault.

  What the role actually decides:

    - the engine command form. Every role runs `vllm serve` (the image's own
      entrypoint, and the only CLI that handles --headless). `single` keeps the
      exec form (no shell). Multi-node pods need a shell, for two reasons
      that both matter:
        * --node-rank has to come from ${LWS_WORKER_INDEX} at runtime.
        * the rdma-injector webhook only prepends its
          `source /etc/gpu-node/nccl-ib.env` (the per-node NCCL_IB_HCA pipeline)
          to containers started as bash/sh -c. An exec-form container gets the
          hostPath mount and nothing else -- RDMA then silently falls back to
          the wrong HCA rather than failing.
      Neither form is built under commandOverride, which also frees
      model.localPath and model.gpus to be empty (see values.yaml).
    - --nnodes / --node-rank / --master-addr / --master-port /
      --distributed-executor-backend, added only for lws roles (and pd roles
      whose own size >= 2), plus --headless on workers.
    - probes, the hang-watcher sidecar and the container port: `serves` roles
      only. There is nothing listening on a worker to probe.
    - preStop: see vllm.preStopScript.

  Call it as:  include "vllm.podSpec" (dict "root" $ "role" "leader")

  The work is split into three defines so the pd colocate shape can put TWO
  engines (and two hang-watchers) into ONE pod without copying the engine
  container:

    vllm.engineIdentity   turns a role into everything the engine command and
                          its probes/preStop need -- the flags, the pd trio,
                          the colocate port-name offset -- as a YAML dict, so
                          a caller two hundred lines away reads ONE source of
                          truth instead of re-deriving it. Renders nothing on
                          its own; the dict is the whole output.
    vllm.engineContainers the engine's container list item, plus the
                          hang-watcher sidecar that watches it. Consumes the
                          identity dict. Emits list items only (no
                          `containers:` key) so colocate can interleave its
                          router container.
    vllm.podSpec          the whole one-engine pod: prologue, the identity,
                          initContainers, `containers:` + engineContainers,
                          then the volumes/scheduling scaffold.

  The pd router's readiness chain: only report the router as Ready when
  every engine role has at least one reachable upstream. The probe calls
  /health on the engines directly, never the router's own port: asking the
  router cannot answer the question -- a router holding a dead upstream
  list keeps its port open just the same. /health on vllm calls
  engine_client.check_health(), deeper than the sglang equivalent; the
  engines' own readinessProbe and the hang-watcher sidecar still own the
  "wedged scheduler" verdict, so this probe only needs the shallowest
  question answered: "is at least one engine process behind this router
  alive and taking HTTP". During model load /health fails (which is
  precisely why the engines' own startupProbe carries the 90-minute
  budget), so the router correctly reads not-Ready throughout the load.

  Known gap this does not close: after engines are healthy, a wedged
  scheduler keeps serving /health 200 from cached frontend state, and
  the headless Services publish not-ready addresses -- so a post-
  startup wedge is invisible to this probe. Hang-watcher owns that
  failure mode (it restarts the engine), and the new engine's IP
  eventually goes stale in the router's argv -- the staleness self-
  healing PR addresses that layer.

  Caller passes a dict role -> {host, port}:
    A/B      the slice's per-role headless FQDN -- script resolves every
             A-record IP and passes on the first 200.
    colocate 127.0.0.1 -- literal, skips resolution.
  Same probe spec, same shape both ways.

  Emits startupProbe and readinessProbe back-to-back at the caller's
  indent. startupProbe carries the engines' 90-minute load budget so a
  router pod scheduled before its engines have loaded is not
  liveness-restarted. readinessProbe ticks at 30s because each call
  costs an engine, even a shallow one -- the engines' own probes can
  afford 10s because the kubelet runs them; doubling the cadence by
  stacking a router copy on top is money for no signal.

  The probe runs python3+urllib, never curl or wget: vllm/vllm-router
  is a Rust-binary image that ships neither (same constraint the
  preStop drain hook on the engine pod documents). python3 + urllib is
  the lowest-common-denominator HTTP client in vllm-derived images.

  The preStop hook's drain script.

  Stage 1a (endpointSyncSeconds) always waits: Kubernetes removes the pod from
  the EndpointSlice and runs this hook at the SAME time, and the pod has no way
  to observe that removal. Stage 1b then watches vLLM's own metrics and returns
  as soon as the server goes idle, so a quiet pod shuts down in about
  endpointSyncSeconds rather than always burning drainSeconds.

  Two cases the loop has to tell apart, because both look like "no number":

    a blip          one unreadable scrape. Keep waiting -- cutting a drain short
                    on a transient error is exactly what the drain is for.
    no server       /metrics unreadable for ~30s running. Nothing to drain (the
                    port never bound, or the engine is already gone), and sitting
                    out the rest of drainSeconds would only hold the GPUs while
                    the replacement waits for them.

  Missing series are the same class of mistake in the other direction: summing
  over nothing yields 0.0, which reads as "idle" and ends the drain immediately.
  inflight() reports None instead, so a renamed or unmounted metric makes the
  hook wait rather than silently skip.

  The tail (`kill`) exists because of how LWS tears a group down. It deletes the leader FIRST, so the leader takes SIGTERM while its
  workers are still running and still expecting it in the next collective. If
  vLLM's shutdown then blocks inside cross-node NCCL, the pod burns the entire
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds before the kubelet SIGKILLs it -- holding its
  GPUs the whole time, which on a full cluster is exactly what the replacement
  group is waiting for.

  What the tail may NOT do is SIGKILL PID 1. A process inside a PID namespace
  cannot kill that namespace's init: the kernel drops signals the init has no
  handler for, and SIGKILL can never have one (man 7 pid_namespaces). kill(2)
  still returns 0, so it reads as success while doing nothing.

  What works is the pair below. SIGTERM to PID 1 IS delivered, because vLLM
  installs a handler for it -- so the hook starts the real shutdown itself,
  inside the grace period. Then it waits: if PID 1 exits, the kernel tears the
  PID namespace down and takes this hook with it, so simply surviving that sleep
  means vLLM is wedged. At that point its CHILDREN get SIGKILLed -- they carry no
  such protection -- and their death lets PID 1 exit on its own.

  Why the kill half exists at all: vLLM deleted mid-load misses SIGTERM (uvicorn has
  not installed its handler yet), finishes booting, and then holds its GPUs until the
  kubelet SIGKILLs it at terminationGracePeriodSeconds -- an hour, for these values.
  Both roles hit that, which is why `kill` is not lws-only; the caller decides.
