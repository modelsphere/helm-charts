{{/*
  The name every resource this chart owns is called.

  Defaults to the release name, unadorned. One release serves one model, so the
  release name IS the name, and nothing needs a suffix to stay unique -- the two
  components that would otherwise collide, the metrics mock and the CART
  subchart, keep their own suffixed identity and are deliberately NOT routed
  through this helper.

  fullnameOverride exists for one reason: releases installed before the resource
  names were simplified, when the engine Deployment was <release>-vllm.
  Renaming a live Deployment is a delete-and-create, not a rolling update, and on
  a GPU node the replacement cannot even schedule until the old pod releases its
  GPU -- so the upgrade costs the full termination grace period plus a cold model
  load, rather than a rolling restart. Pinning

      fullnameOverride: <release>-vllm

  keeps that Deployment exactly where it is and makes the upgrade ordinary.

  It does not restore the older Service (<release>-vllm-svc) or LLMScaler
  (<release>-scaler): those carried different suffixes, and one value cannot be
  three names. Both are still recreated, which costs a new ClusterIP and an
  operator re-adopt but no pod restart -- and the route survives it, because the
  ModelRoute's top peer tier is direct pod IPs rather than the Service.

  Leave it empty on new releases.

{{/*
  The preStop hook's drain script.

  Stage 1a (endpointSyncSeconds) always waits: Kubernetes removes the pod from
  the EndpointSlice and runs this hook at the SAME time, and the pod has no way
  to observe that removal. Stage 1b then watches vLLM's own metrics and returns
  as soon as the server goes idle, so a quiet pod shuts down in about
  endpointSyncSeconds rather than always burning drainSeconds.

  Two cases the loop has to tell apart, because both look like "no number":

    a blip          one unreadable scrape. Keep waiting -- cutting a drain short
                    on a transient error is exactly what the drain is for.
    no server       /metrics unreadable for ~30s running. Nothing to drain (the
                    port never bound, or the engine is already gone), and sitting
                    out the rest of drainSeconds would only hold the GPUs while
                    the replacement waits for them.

  Missing series are the same class of mistake in the other direction: summing
  over nothing yields 0.0, which reads as "idle" and ends the drain immediately.
  inflight() reports None instead, so a renamed or unmounted metric makes the
  hook wait rather than silently skip.

  The tail (`kill`) exists because of how LWS tears a group down. It deletes the leader FIRST, so the leader takes SIGTERM while its
  workers are still running and still expecting it in the next collective. If
  vLLM's shutdown then blocks inside cross-node NCCL, the pod burns the entire
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds before the kubelet SIGKILLs it -- holding its
  GPUs the whole time, which on a full cluster is exactly what the replacement
  group is waiting for.

  What the tail may NOT do is SIGKILL PID 1. A process inside a PID namespace
  cannot kill that namespace's init: the kernel drops signals the init has no
  handler for, and SIGKILL can never have one (man 7 pid_namespaces). kill(2)
  still returns 0, so it reads as success while doing nothing.

  What works is the pair below. SIGTERM to PID 1 IS delivered, because vLLM
  installs a handler for it -- so the hook starts the real shutdown itself,
  inside the grace period. Then it waits: if PID 1 exits, the kernel tears the
  PID namespace down and takes this hook with it, so simply surviving that sleep
  means vLLM is wedged. At that point its CHILDREN get SIGKILLed -- they carry no
  such protection -- and their death lets PID 1 exit on its own.

  Why the kill half exists at all: vLLM deleted mid-load misses SIGTERM (uvicorn has
  not installed its handler yet), finishes booting, and then holds its GPUs until the
  kubelet SIGKILLs it at terminationGracePeriodSeconds -- an hour, for these values.
  Both roles hit that, which is why `kill` is not lws-only; the caller decides.
